# Blog_TacoTemplate
My first basic html website code
Created a simple website about a place that sells Tacos.
The website uses three html files:
- Main file which is the home page
- The Store Hours file
- The Contact Info about the place file.
I didn't use much css coding yet however once I am familiar with css coding I will implement it for this particular website.
